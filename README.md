# Climate Integration Meta-repo

The purpose of the repo is to be an easy yet comprehensive way to interact with [basd](https://github.com/JGCRI/basd), the Python package that allows you to **bias adjust** and **statistically downscale** arbitrary climate data, <u>without having to write a single line of code</u>, in a way that interacts with other climate tools [STITCHES](https://github.com/JGCRI/stitches) and [Hector](https://github.com/JGCRI/hector).
